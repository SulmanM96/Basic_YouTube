          <h3> JJump Force Trailer</h3>
          <li>ump Force has a huge character list from across weekly manga anthology Shonen Jump's history, with a roster featuring icons from Yu-Gi-Oh!, Bleach, One Piece, Dragon Ball Z and more. It's a tag-team fighting game featuring 3v3 battles in multi-part, 3D stages. You’ll be fighting in scenes based on real world locations, such as Himeji Castle, Hong Kong, San Francisco and New York, as well as series-specific settings. Your team shares a health bar.</li>
          <h4> What we know </h4>
          <li>As of the end of 2018, 33 heroes and villains from 13 different Weekly Shonen Jump series have been announced as part of the full character list. That’s not including Death Note’s Light Yagami, the megalomaniacal college student with a deadly jotting pad, or his death God sidekick Ryuk, both of whom won’t get their hands dirty directly but will play a role in the game’s story mode. Here's a breakdown of the line-up. Be warned, it gets extremely anime. </li>
